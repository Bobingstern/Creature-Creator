# Creature-Creator
Make a [Creature](https://bobingstern.github.io/Creature-Creator/) and watch it learn how to walk!

Choose from different modes on the left. Click on one spot and click on another to make a rectangle. To make a joint, click one body and then another and choose the joint anchor location. Press A and D to rotate one limit and the LEFT RIGHT arrows to move the second join limit and press ENTER to confirm

Py Proudest project with a few thousand lines of code made in collaboration with UnsignedArduino. Still a little buggy but gets the point of evolution across.
